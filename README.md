## Introduction 
Alzheimer_s_Disease_and_Healthy_Aging_Data dataset to gain insights into various aspects of Alzheimer’s disease and related health metrics. This analysis will help to understand the distribution and trends of Alzheimer’s disease across different geolocations, demographic groups, and time periods. The ultimate goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform public health strategies and policies.

## Statement of the Problem

Alzheimer’s disease is a significant public health challenge, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Understanding its distribution and impact requires detailed analysis of relevant data. The specific problems addressed in this project include:

1. Determining the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease across different locations.
2. Analyzing the trends of Alzheimer’s disease over time.
3. Comparing data values across various demographic and geographic segments.
4. Identifying potential correlations between data values and confidence intervals.
5. Examining the distribution of data values across different stratification categories.

## Skills Demonstrated
I conducted comprehensive data analysis using SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data, applying statistical techniques for averages, confidence intervals, and distribution metrics, while ensuring data quality through cleaning operations. Leveraging domain knowledge in public health and Alzheimer’s disease, I generated meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.

## Insight
-  There are 7 unique classes, 39 unique topics, and 39 unique questions in the dataset.
-   The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is significantly higher in certain locations, indicating geographic hotspots that may require targeted interventions.
-   The geolocation POINT (-64.896335 18.335765) has the highest data value.
-   The geolocation POINT (-108.1098304 43.23554134) has the lowest data value.
-   Virgin Islands has the highest High_Confidence_Limit with a value of 47.2.
-   Hawaii has the lowest High_Confidence_Limit with a value of 40.5.
-   Different geolocations exhibit varying average data values, reflecting regional differences in Alzheimer’s disease metrics.
-   The comparison of confidence intervals across topics reveals the reliability and variability of data values, which is crucial for assessing data quality.
-   The average age reported in the dataset is 37.5 years.
-   The distribution analysis across different stratifications provides insights into how various demographic or categorical factors influence Alzheimer’s disease metrics.

## Recommendations

- Targeted Interventions: Focus public health efforts on geographic hotspots identified through the prevalence analysis to provide targeted support and resources.
- Time-based Strategies: Develop time-based intervention strategies that align with the observed trends in Alzheimer’s disease data over the years.
- Regional Programs: Implement regional health programs in areas with significant variations in data values to address local factors contributing to Alzheimer’s disease.
- Data Quality Improvement: Enhance data collection methods to improve the precision and reliability of reported data values, especially in topics with high variability in confidence intervals.
- Demographic-specific Policies: Formulate policies that address the specific needs of different demographic groups as indicated by the stratification analysis.
- Age-Specific Strategies: Given the average age of 37.5 years, design age-specific health interventions and awareness programs to effectively address the needs of this demographic.
- Stratification Category Focus: Allocate resources and develop initiatives based on the frequency of stratification categories, with particular attention to Race/Ethnicity and Gender, which are highly represented in the data.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Alzheimer_s_Disease_and_Healthy_Aging_Data dataset provides valuable insights into the prevalence, trends, and distribution of Alzheimer’s disease across different geolocations and demographic segments. These insights can inform public health strategies and interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of Alzheimer’s disease and promoting healthy aging.
